# Easy Budget
## An easy way to enter in your expendatures and work on building a budget


### Initial Thoughts
1. add a bill and what you paid for it (for this month)
    - estimate what next month may be
2. add a income
    - estimate what next month may be
3. be able to show the income is split into different accounts
    - not everyone gets money into one account (i have 3)
