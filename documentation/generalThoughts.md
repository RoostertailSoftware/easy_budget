# General Thoughts and Ideas

## Why?
Well, basically, I want to learn Rust.  

### In that, I was thinking of using:
1. Rust to be the API and serve up the UI.
2. I like Angular so, I am going to stick to that for the UI
3. I like mongo and so, I am going to use Mongo for the db.

That is the basics in 3 lines.

## What I am looking for

* I don't like other budgets -- they just don't do what I thought they should
* They tend to not allow the flexability I want

## What I want for the overall design

### Obvious things are 
* easy of use
* easy on the eyes
* some big buttons and not a lot of hidden things
* Not having to go down rabbit holes to see the data
* graphs to grasp harder to get ideas and see categories
* print some reports as needed

## Model
* Again, I am going to start with some SysML and UML to build the overall structure of how things will work.
* I will use Balsamiq to design the UI according to the Requirements
