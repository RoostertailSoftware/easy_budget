# General Thoughts and Ideas

## Why?
Well, basically, I want to learn Rust.  In that, I was thinking of using Rust to be the API and serve up the UI.
I like Angular so, I am going to stick to that for the UI
I like mongo and so, I am going to use Mongo for the db.


## What I am looking for

* I don't like other budgets -- they just don't do what I thought they should
* They tend to not allow the flexability I want

## What I want for the overall design
* 

## What it should act like

## Model
* Again, I am going to start with some SysML and UML to build the overall structure of how things will work.
* I will use Balsamiq to design the UI according to the Requirements
