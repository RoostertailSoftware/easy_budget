# Easy Budget
## An easy way to enter in your expendatures and work on building a budget

### Initial Thoughts
1. add a bill and what you paid for it (for this month)
    - estimate what next month may be
2. add a income
    - estimate what next month may be
3. be able to show the income is split into different accounts
    - not everyone gets money into one account (i have 3)
4. be able to show money coming from your income into investments
5. be able to show how much mony is going into taxes
6. basically a breakdown of income ....
7. be able to see at a glance:
    * how much you have, 
    * how much is left to go out (estimated bills not yet paid),
    * how much you have going into investments
    * how much you have to play with

In short, a budget program. Because, no one has done one yet ....
